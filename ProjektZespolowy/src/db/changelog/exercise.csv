Flexing forearms to support back on benches  ,1,"Hands stacked at the end of the bench, feet based on the other bench, body suspended in the air; - take breath and bend your forearms and after that straightenthem back (push back on them); - take breath in final phase of exercise. Exercise engages triceps brachii muscle, pectorals and front part of  shoulder muscles. On thighs you can put weight and thanks to it pushing will be harder and effort will be more intense."
Pull-over with barbells in the suspine position on horizontal bench,1,"Arms lifted upward, barbell held with wide-grip(grip the neck on witdh of shoulders): -take breath, taking to lungs as much air as possible and leave the barbell behind your head, slightly bending upper limbs in elbows; -exhale and return to start possition. This exercise develops pectoralis major muscle lats as well as front toothed muscles, rhomboid muscles and pectoralis minor muscle.This exercise is made with a small load  "
Bending arms  on the armrests (swedish pumps),1,"Arms straight, based on handrails, lower limbs hang without touching the floor: -take breath and bend completly forearms so that breast will be at the height of the ralling:- exhale at the final phase of exercise. The deeper trunk tilt forward the fuller commitment of pectorial muscles (the inner part of them) and vice versa the more straight torso the fuller triceps brachii muscles work."
Alternately lifting arms to the side with using the low cable pulley.,1,"Lift handle in your hand, arm along the trunk: -take breath and lift arm to horizon: -exhale in the final phase of movement. This exercise develops deltoid, mainly the middle multipennate muscle ie. composed of several pen-shaped parts that's why it's so important to change angles under which rises arms in order to engage all muscle bands."
Pumps (bending arms in front support),1,"Arms straighten based on ground, spaced shoulder width (or wider), feet near each other or slight gape between them: -take breath and bend arms so the chest will be near floor without bending over the back in the lumbar region; -exhale in the final phase of movement. This is an exelent exercise for the pectoralis major muscle and triceps brachii muscle. It can be done everywhere."
Rising dumbbells in kneel propped on the bench,1,"Dumbell held in one hand with half conversion, second hand bend and bent at knee lower limb based on bench; -secure back, take breath and pull dumbell the most possible height, holding arm near body and restoring hard elbow to the back: -exhale in the final phase of movement. In order to achive maximum muscle tension you can slightly turn your chest in the final phase of the pull. This exercise involves mainly latissimus dorsi muscle, teres major muscle, the rear parts of the deltoid and trapezius and rhomboid muscles (in the final phase) and also flexor muscles of the arms (mainly biceps)"
Raising knees on the abdominal muscles machine,2,"Based on elbows, back locked: -take breath and pull knees to your chest, bend back to arc in order to streetch muscles abdominal pressure: -exhale in final phase of movement. This exercise involves muscles of hip flexors, mainly ilio-lumbar muscles as well as the obliques and the rectus abdominis, the latter is engaged intensively in its lower part."
Lifting arms with dumbbells in lateral decubitus position,2,"In lateral decubitus position on the floor or bench, dumbbells held with wide-grip: -take breath and rise arm to level; exhale in the final phase of movement. Unlike lifting arms in standing position which involves gradualy deltoid muscle up to reaching maximum intensity of effort in the final phase (when arms come to level) in this exercise effort is foccused in the initial phase of lifting. The best results are obtainded by doing 10-20 repetitions"
Lifting dumbbells lying on your back,2,"In the lying possition on horizontal bench, feet supported on the ground, upper limb bent at elbows, dumbells held with wide-grip at the height of brest: -take breath and straighten upper limbs vertically and at the same turning the forearms so that hands will face each other: -when hands will be facing each other make isometric contraction in order to focus effort in sterno-ribbed part of pectoral major muscles: -exhale in final phase of movement. This exercise reminds lifting barbells but because of the greater amplitude of movement it promotes the pectorial major muscle tension.  When performing this exercise also works triceps and front part of the shoulder muscle."
Straighten elbows with barbells in the lying position on bench,2,"In the lying position on bench, barbell held with wide-grip, arms arranged vertivally in relation to the bench: -take breath and bent arms trying not to dissaude too in back elbows while lowering the barbell at the height of forehead -exhale in the final phase of movement"
Rising the lower limbs on the inclide bench with flexion of the spine and lifting the plevis,2,"Lying on the inclide bench, hands on the railing or stick: -rise lower limbs to the vertical, then rise plevis, bend the spine and try to touch your head with knees. Exercise engages iliopsoas muscle while rising lower limbs, tensor fasciae latae and biceps of thigh (part of quadriceps muscle) during the bending of the spine is engaging abdominal pressure."
