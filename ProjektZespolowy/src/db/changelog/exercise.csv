Exercise engages triceps brachii muscle, pectorals and front part of  shoulder muscles. On thighs you can put weight and thanks to it pushing will be harder and effort will be more intense."
Pull-over with barbells in the suspine position on horizontal bench,1,"Arms lifted upward, barbell is held with wide-grip(grip the neck on witdh of shoulders): -take breath, taking to lungs as much air as possible and leave the barbell behind your head, slightly bending upper limbs in elbows; -exhale and return to start possition. This exercise develops pectoralis major muscle lats as well as front toothed muscles, rhomboid muscles and pectoralis minor muscle.This exercise is made with a small load  "
Bending arms  on the armrests (swedish pumps),1,"Arms straight, based on handrails, lower limbs hang without touching the floor: -take breath and bend completly forearms so that breast will be at the height of the ralling:- exhale at the final phase of exercise. The deeper trunk tilt forward the fuller commitment of pectorial muscles (the inner part of them) and vice versa the more straight torso the fuller triceps brachii muscles work."
Alternately lifting arms to the side with using the low cable pulley.,1,"Lift handle in your hand, arm along the trunk: -take breath and lift arm to horizon: -exhale in the final phase of movement. This exercise develops deltoid, mainly the middle multipennate muscle ie. composed of several pen-shaped parts that's why it's so important to change angles under which rises arms in order to engage all muscle bands."
Pumps (bending arms in front support),1,"Arms straighten based on ground, spaced shoulder width (or wider), feet near each other or slight gape between them: -take breath and bend arms so the chest will be near floor without bending over the back in the lumbar region; -exhale in the final phase of movement.
